abstract: "Preventive war arises from fears of future power shifts threatening the status quo. However, critics argue that since power shifts can be influenced by states' strategic decisions, preventive war can always be avoided. Through a lab experiment and a representative survey, this paper investigates how statesâ€™ endogenous decisions affect the likelihood of conflict. We focus on two strategies: a containment policy, where rising states halt their own growth to prevent power shifts, and a commitment policy, where rising states make binding future offers without altering power shift trajectories. Our findings show that while both policies reduce the likelihood of preventive war, containment is a much less preferred policy. Additionally, declining states often resort to costly coercive containment measures rather than trusting rising states' self-containment. In the representative survey, we pose conceptually similar questions to understand broader public opinions regarding international politics and find consistent patterns with the experimental results."
