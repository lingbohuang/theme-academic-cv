abstract: "We experimentally study how individuals strategically use communication to signal strength or weakness in bargaining under the shadow of conflict. Using a two-stage model that combines a Nash demand game with a Tullock contest, we analyze both complete and asymmetric information settings. Experimental results show that asymmetric information increases conflict and incentivizes bluffing, with weak-type individuals often imitating the strong by making high demands. One-way communication encourages weak-type players to send bluffing messages about their fighting strength and make high demands accordingly; their opponents respond by partially conceding. Strong-type players sometimes feign weakness by understating their strength while still making high demands; however, this strategy does not improve their payoffs. Our findings highlight the potentially adverse impact of strategic messaging on bargaining efficiency."
